## Development

* TODO: 
* Helm.sh is a simple [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site, built with a custom theme. To run the website locally, you'll need to first [install](https://gohugo.io/getting-started) Hugo extended edition and any dependencies.

```
brew install hugo
yarn install
```

You can then compile and run the site locally:

```
hugo serve
```

### How to Write a Blog Post
* TODO:
Blog posts are created via pull requests. The following steps are used to add them:

1) Add a new file to the `content/en/blog/` directory whose name is the published date and the title. The files must be markdown formatted. See the existing titles for examples of the format
2) Add the header meta-data to the file using this format (note the permalink structure). Recommended but optional fields are `authorname` which should be name(s); these are displayed verbatim. `authorlink` is the link used by `authorname`.

```yaml
---
title: "A Fancy Title"
slug: "fancy-title"
authorname: "Captain Awesome"
authorlink: "https://example.com"
date: "yyyy-mm-dd"
---
```

3) Add the content below the `---` as Markdown. The title does not need to be included in this section
4) Any images should be placed in the `/content/en/blog/images/` directory. Images should be losslessly compressed to reduce their size. Tools, such as [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/), can be used.
5) To summarize the content on the blog index page, insert a `<!--more-->` break in your markdown. This will truncate the content with a _Read More_ link.

Blog PRs require approval from the core Helm [maintainers](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/OWNERS) before merge.
